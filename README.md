# ‚ö° Polish Traffic Signs Classification App

<div align="center">This Flask application presents how a Convolutional Neural Network model can classify polish traffic signs images.



Demo running on Google Cloud:

### Please note the model was trained on 92 classes available in the dataset. Full list of classes can be find in the web application in "Important note" tab.

## ‚ùì Why?

Traffic signs classification is one of the most popular projects for people learning Deep Learning. The most popular dataset for this issue is GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark. 
I wanted to try traffic signs classification but on a different dataset. 
When I discovered [this dataset shared on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kasia12345/polish-traffic-signs-dataset) - a 92-classes dataset made of polish traffic signs - I knew I have to use it for my next project.

Notebook of the model will be shared soon on Kaggle.
